The four projects I chose for my portfolio are the bot, the poem, the screensaver, and the novel.

My bot did not contain enough information as to what it was supposed to be about when I first submitted it.  The inspiration behind my bot
is a function in the game Toontown Rewritten called the "Pick-A-Name Generator."  This is a naming option to choose when you are first
creating your toon (avatar).  You can either pick a name combination from the given list or type your own.  Since the generator in the game
already has a specific style and structure, I decided to make it into a bot by giving players ideas to generate a new name combination that
has not been used in the game yet.  The amount of names I included in the bot in the beginning were less than half of the total amount of names, so I added more name choices for the bot to generate more combinations.

My poem

My screensaver was a simple animation that contained a ball bouncing around the screen and leaving a trail of circles behind.  Using this same code from Owen Roberts, I approached my screensaver to make it look like it is creating an art piece.  I was inspired by the pattern on wooden chairs and mosaic tiles.  The animation for the screensaver lasts _ minutes, and when it stops completely, it finishes with a pattern where some spaces are not filled by circles.  The beginning stages of the screensaver contain a diamond pattern, and they gradually increase as the time elapses.  There is a point at around 8 minutes when the screensaver starts to fill with white circles.  You are still able to see the trail moving, but the effect works better when you squint your eyes.  It creates a white glowing beam as the animation continues until it stops completely.

My previous novel used the scripts from the movies <i>Detective Pikachu</i> and <i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</i>.  When I looked back at it,
I noticed that there were some phrases my code recorded such as "font=color" and "/font."  I modified the scripts and removed all of the
"fonts" phrases.  There were also some script lines from <i>Christmas Vacation</i> that were repeated, so I also removed those.
