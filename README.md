The four projects I chose for my portfolio are the bot, the poem, the screensaver, and the novel.

My bot did not contain enough information as to what it was supposed to be about when I first submitted it.  The inspiration behind my bot
is a function in the game Toontown Rewritten called the "Pick-A-Name Generator."  This is a naming option to choose when you are first
creating your toon (avatar).  You can either pick a name combination from the given list or type your own.  Since the generator in the game
already has a specific style and structure, I decided to make it into a bot by giving players ideas to generate a new name combination that
has not been used in the game yet.

My poem

My screensaver

My previous novel used the scripts from the movies <i>Detective Pikachu</i> and <i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</i>.  When I looked back at it,
I noticed that there were some phrases my code recorded such as "font=color" and "/font."  I modified the scripts and removed all of the
"fonts" phrases.  There were also some script lines from <i>Christmas Vacation</i> that were repeated, so I also removed those.
